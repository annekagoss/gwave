			Gwave is an interactive browser-based gravitational wave visualizer which allows users to send selected wave signals through simulated space. Unlike other existing digital representations of gravitational waves, Gwave shows spacetime as both a 3-dimensional plane (x, y and time axes), and also as a 4-dimensional cube, closer to how we naturally perceive the universe.</br></br>

		 Gravitational waves originate from binary black hole or neutron star systems. In the case of this data, two black holes lost gravitational energy as they gradually grew closer together and coalesced into a single supermassive black hole.

		 As the resulting ripples propagated through spacetime, they expanded and contracted objects in their path by a factor of </br>10<sup>-21</sup>, or about 10 times the size of an atomic nucleus. This effect of distorted space is difficult to imagine from waveforms and static visualizations alone. Gwave is an attempt to bridge that gap between the raw gravitational wave data and our intuitive understanding and perception of the space that surrounds us.</br></br>

			The gravitational wave data was made public by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the Virgo Collaboration. The first ever detected, the signals mark the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave physics and provide previously undetectable information about the origins of the universe. The data is processed using the python signal processing guides provided by LIGO as a part of their public data release.
